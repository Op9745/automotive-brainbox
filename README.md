üöó Automotive Brainbox ‚Äì ADAS, HIL, Python Automation Portfolio

Welcome to **Automotive Brainbox**, a hands-on learning lab and professional portfolio built to demonstrate real-world capabilities in:

- Automotive software development
- ADAS feature validation
- Python-based automation
- HIL (Hardware-in-the-Loop) simulation
- Vehicle network testing
- Functional safety (ISO 26262)

This project brings together industry-relevant workflows, scripts, and automation frameworks tailored for Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs) and ECU validation environments.

üîß Features

- ‚úÖ **PyTest + Behave + Robot Framework** for test automation  
- ‚úÖ **BDD Scenarios** with Gherkin for ADAS logic simulation  
- ‚úÖ **CAN/LIN scripting** for ECU signal simulation  
- ‚úÖ **HIL bench planning** for Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and more  
- ‚úÖ **AUTOSAR architecture notes** and configuration templates  
- ‚úÖ **Functional Safety (ISO 26262)** docs and sample FMEA  
- ‚úÖ **GitHub Actions CI** with Allure report generation  
- ‚úÖ **OpenCV demo (optional)** for Camera-LiDAR object detection
